                <p>
                    The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing Chicago's
                    northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL,
                    you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by o
                    small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league
                    members.
